</p><p>In the Scripture the ultimate responsibility for teaching and training the children about spiritual things is usually the father, but what mothers influence in their children is immeasurable.</p>
<p>Here are some things mom taught us:</p>
<p>Mothers teach us about FORESIGHT: Make sure you wear clean underwear in case you’re in an accident.</p>
<p>Mothers teach us about LOGIC: If you fall out of a tree and break your neck, don’t come crying to me.</p>
<p>Mothers teach us about RELIGION: You better pray that comes out of the carpet.</p>
<p>Mothers teach us about TIME TRAVEL: If you don’t straighten up I’m going to knock you into the middle of next week.</p>
<p>Mothers teach us about GENETICS: You’re just like your father.</p>
<p>Mothers teach us about CONTRADICTIONS: Shut your mouth and eat your dinner.</p>
<p>Mothers teach us about  CONTORTIONS: Will you look at the dirt on the back of your neck?</p>
<p>Mothers teach us about the CIRCLE OF LIFE: I brought you into this world and I’ll take you out of it.</p>
<p>Mother’s know!!  They know that kitchen utensils are probably going to wind up outside shoveling dirt. They know that having sticky floors and dirty ovens = happy kids.  They know  dried play dough doesn’t come out of shag carpet.  They know they’d like to be able to eat a whole candy bar (all by themselves) and drink a Diet Coke w/o any “floaters” in it.  They know that just once a week they would like to eat a hot meal.</p>
<p>Mother’s are incredible, influential teachers.</p>
<p>Matthew 20: 20-23 reads</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to Him with her sons, kneeling down and asking something from Him.  And He said to her, What do you wish?  She said to Him, Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on the left, in Your kingdom.  But Jesus answered and said, You do not know what you ask.  Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?  They said to Him, We are able.  So He said to them, You will indeed drink My cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it is prepared by My Father.”</div>
</div>
<p>Matthew 20.20-23, is a text usually preached to showcase negative attitudes &amp; wrong thinking and rightly so.</p>
<p>Most scholars believe that the woman in our text is quite possibly a woman by the name of Salome’. They come to this conclusion by looking at the women who stood vigil at the cross.</p>
<p>Matthew 27:56 reads:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">” among whom were Mary Magdalene Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons”.</div>
</div>
<p>Mark 15:40 reads:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joses and Salome.</div>
</div>
<p>John 19:25 reads:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</div>
</div>
<p>Salome is the sister of Jesus’ mother.  Jesus’ Aunt Salome’; James &amp; John were probably Jesus’ first cousins!</p>
<p>At first it’s a story of a mother (Salome’) trying to get her two boys cushy jobs with the State.  When Salome talks about Jesus’ Kingdom in verse 21, she’s not thinking in the spiritual, heavenly realm but rather as a Kingdom that will overthrow the Romans who are occupying Israel. (Restore Israel’s former glory)</p>
<p>You see the boys had been brought up by their father, Zebedee, to be fishermen. That was hard work and a hard life. She thought working as one of the King’s advisors seemed a whole lot easier way to make a living than fishing Galilee.</p>
<p>In these three verses there are some “how to’s” and “what to’s” that Salome’ can teach us.</p>
<p>We learn where to go to get the best in life. As Salome’ approached Jesus, bringing with her two adult sons with a perceived need in their life: hoping he would find favor with her sons. She brings herself, her kids and her requests to the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>Doesn’t scripture tell us to bring our needs (&amp; even wants) to the Lord.</p>
<p>She doesn’t come alone; she brings her kids!</p>
<p>There are things that are taught and there are things that can only be caught.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed that children imitate their parents (words, sense of humor, good, bad, ugly and often even an attitude.)</p>
<p>Your children may not always succeed in listening to you but they will never fail to imitate you.</p>
<p>Salome’ had knelt down before Jesus (as her Messiah).  For all she did wrong she showed respect, submission, respect &amp; affection. (Ever see a man kneel to kiss a woman’s hand? Same thing!)</p>
<p>Her kids caught mom’s attitude toward Jesus.</p>
<p>James becomes a martyr for the church &amp; John is persecuted and put in exile.</p>
<blockquote>
Parents, you need to have an attitude of respect, servanthood,  &amp; affection for Jesus, His Church, His People, the leaders He puts over you and teach it to your children.</blockquote>
<p>There are many things we can teach our kids, advantages we try to provide for them . . .</p>
<p>Wealth, education, power and success, Ecclesiastes 12:8 reads “Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, All is vanity”, the translation is all of that is meaningless.  What does count?  Ecclesiastes 12:13 reads “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God and keep His commandments, For this is man’s all”.  You can have all of those things, wealth, education, power and success but without God life is meaningless and empty.</p>
<p>The greatest advantage we can give our children is a solid foundation in their relationship with God. We need to show them that we are good disciples of the Lord..</p>
<p>Salome also teaches us what to do when Jesus doesn’t give us what we ask for.</p>
<p>Salome’ asks Jesus for her boys to have seats of honor, prestige, power &amp; authority. To be “somebodies” in His Kingdom.</p>
<p>Her request was based on a promise given in Matthew 19.28 which reads “So Jesus said to them, Assuredly I say to you, that in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>This is another testimony to her true heart: she believed in Jesus’ promises!</p>
<p>Jesus says, “You don’t know what you’re asking! . . . but you will drink from it!”She didn’t say another word, plead her case, make a deal . . . She just accepted His word as truth!</p>
<p>She just put everything in His hands and left it there. What a testimony, what a Legacy!</p>
<p>Salome’ is the feminine of the Hebrew word for Shalom, which means peace!</p>
<p>I think her name suits her because she had  two sons who loved Jesus. Her own heart was submitted to His. You can’t help but have “peace” when you’re trusting His hand, heart, word, promises. When you don’t get what you asked for you still go looking to be with Jesus!</p>
<p>Checkout who’s at the tomb on Easter morning! Mark 16:1 reads “Now when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices that they might come and anoint Him.</p>
<p>He didn’t give her what she wanted but she didn’t get mad, she wasn’t upset or bitter.</p>
<p>She just kept after Jesus she was at the cross at the tomb.</p>
<p>Mom’s when your prayers are not answered the way you want them too just remind yourself that His promises are good &amp; the tomb is still empty.</p>
<p>We learn from her where to go when we want the best for ourselves or our family. What to do when we don’t get what we asked for.</p>
<p>Why does a momma love her newborn baby? I mean for 9 months this baby has brought you nothing but pain. You break out maybe in pimples because of the hormone changes, you get stretch marks, you waddle like a duck when you walk, your legs and feet get swollen, your belly gets big and to show you their appreciation they hit the side of your tummy, made you crave sardines &amp; peanut butter, &amp; throw up every morning.</p>
<p>You kept them warm, safe and dry and they didn’t even give you a thank you.  In fact the moment they are born they begin to cry!</p>
<p>But the first thing that little baby wants is their momma. I mean you’ve been doing all the work for the last 9 months but no break for you!  Dad won’t do . . . they want you.</p>
<p>Your head hurts, your back aches, you screamed/swore, bit bullets, every muscle in your body has been stretched and strained . . . you should be angry, but you’re not. FAR FROM IT.</p>
<p>On your face is a longer-than-forever love. This baby so far has done absolutely nothing for you . . . but you’re crazy for that baby</p>
<p>The baby brought nothing but pain through the process,  nausea in the morning but you love him.</p>
<p>The baby’s face is wrinkled, eyes are dim and all you talk about is how beautiful he or she is and how smart he or she is because they are holding your finger.</p>
<p>You know you are going to be up every night for the next 18 years, you don’t care.</p>
<p>Why? Why does a mother love a newborn? That baby is hers. MORE THAN THAT. That baby  is her flesh, blood, strength, hope, legacy. . .that baby is her.  It doesn’t bother mom in the least bit that the baby gives nothing.  She knows the baby is weak, helpless. She knows the baby didn’t asked to be born into this world.</p>
<p>God knows we didn’t ask to be born either. We’re His idea, we’re His kids. When He sees us He says “He has my face, eyes, hands, touch . . . we have our daddy’s heart.” Your picture is on God’s refrigerator!</p>
<p>A godly mother’s love for her child is only a small taste of the love God has for you.</p>
<p>When He looks at you He sees His finest creation. Ephesians 2:10 reads “For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.  Amen</p>
<p>As we continue with our Mother’s Day theme I would like to read something in honor of all Mother’s everywhere.</p>
<p>Rewards of Having Children by Katherine J. Kehler
“Sons and daughters are a heritage from the Lord, children a reward (gift, blessing) from him” (Psalm 127:3).</p>
<p>I have often read that children are a blessing from the Lord but I had never really thought about why – I was too busy raising them!</p>
<p>In the Old Testament we read again and again how important children were to the family. In fact, women who couldn’t have children felt very defeated. Take Hannah for example – she couldn’t even eat she was so depressed about not having a child.</p>
<p>Today I would like to touch on different ways children are a blessing to us.:</p>
<p>The Wonder and Joy of Birth
It can be likened to the joy of spiritual birth. When you held your newborn babies in your arms for the first time there was a rush of love that flooded over you…the pain of the delivery was all but forgotten.</p>
<p>John 16:21 says,</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“A woman, when she gives birth to a child, has grief (anguish, agony), because her time has come. But when she is delivered of her child, she no longer remembers her pain (trouble, anguish), because she is glad that a man (a child, a human being) has been born into the world.”</div>
</div>
<p>The Daily Delight of Watching the Child Develop…
…waiting for the first smile, hearing the first laugh, being delighted the first time they hold out their arms toward us.</p>
<p>The Pride and Joy When They Have Successful Experiences
Those first tottering steps; giving a recital in public for the first time; that first day of school (how tightly they held my hand or was it the other way around?); doing well in school, sports, music or any competitive events; their wedding day; the day they have their first child. All of these bring great satisfaction to parents.</p>
<p>Children Bring Back the Sense of Wonder in a Person’s Life
Kids carefully examine bugs, flowers, frogs and clouds. There is the fun of kneeling in the garden soil and planting seeds with them and then watching them check every day to see if “God has growed them yet.” It was so much fun to get caught up with their excitement at Christmas and birthday parties. What a thrill to receive that first bouquet of dandelions or “made-in-school” Mothers’ Day or Valentine’s card.</p>
<p>The Blessing of Being Used by God to Comfort Them When They Hurt
At first it is kissing sore fingers or knees, but later it is comforting and helping them through broken relationships, sitting beside them and rubbing their back while they are crying their heart out because of seemingly insurmountable problems. And then it is experiencing God answering your plea for words of comfort and wisdom at the right time.</p>
<p>The Pleasure of Seeing God Change Impossible Situations
Sometimes He does this in an instant but generally He does it in the course of time. Meanwhile, our patience has a chance to grow.</p>
<p>The Blessing of Having our Character Developed
For many years I thought I was training my children but after a while I realized that God was using them to develop me. As parents, we learn perseverance and the meaning of total commitment. Most of the time, commitment to the child comes naturally, but there are times with each child when you simply have to cry to the Lord for love. There are many times when commitment to the child is an act of your will. You never give up on them because Christ doesn’t give up on you.</p>
<p>Another Blessing and Reward is Launching Children Towards Independence and Seeing Them Live What They Learned From You
This is difficult because they don’t need you in the same way anymore; at the same time, it can be tremendously rewarding to see them do some of the things you taught them. The way they keep house or decorate; the way they entertain; their spiritual disciplines; the way they raise their children. When you notice your adult children following God, being involved in their church and tithing, you feel a glow of satisfaction that they have chosen the values you would have chosen for them.</p>
<p>Only when I realized that raising children takes supernatural wisdom, love, strength and patience.  It was after I asked God to direct my life –let His Holy Spirit control me, that I was able to raise them the way God wanted me to do.</p>
<p>Children are such a wonderful and amazing gift from God.  Mother’s are some of the most selfless, kind, compassionate people you will ever meet.  As we close today, I pray that all of the moms out there know how special they are, how loved they are and how inspiring they are to everyone around them.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
