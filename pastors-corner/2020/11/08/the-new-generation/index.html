<h2>The Tribes Renew the Covenant</h2>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">24&nbsp;Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and summoned the elders, the heads, the judges, and the officers of Israel; and they presented themselves before God.</div>
<div class="line">2&nbsp;And Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says the&nbsp;Lord, the God of Israel: Long ago your ancestors—Terah and his sons Abraham and Nahor—lived beyond the Euphrates and served other gods.</div>
<div class="line">3&nbsp;Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River and led him through all the land of Canaan and made his offspring many. I gave him Isaac;</div>
<div class="line">4&nbsp;and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau the hill country of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.</div>
<div class="line">5&nbsp;Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in its midst; and afterwards I brought you out.</div>
<div class="line">6&nbsp;When I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, you came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued your ancestors with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea.</div>
<div class="line">7&nbsp;When they cried out to the&nbsp;Lord, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and made the sea come upon them and cover them; and your eyes saw what I did to Egypt. Afterwards you lived in the wilderness a long time.</div>
<div class="line">8&nbsp;Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived on the other side of the Jordan; they fought with you, and I handed them over to you, and you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you.</div>
<div class="line">9&nbsp;Then King Balak son of Zippor of Moab, set out to fight against Israel. He sent and invited Balaam son of Beor to curse you,</div>
<div class="line">10&nbsp;but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore, he blessed you; so, I rescued you out of his hand.</div>
<div class="line">11&nbsp;When you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho, the citizens of Jericho fought against you, and also the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I handed them over to you.</div>
<div class="line">12&nbsp;I sent the hornet&nbsp;ahead of you, which drove out before you the two kings of the Amorites; it was not by your sword or by your bow.</div>
<div class="line">13&nbsp;I gave you a land on which you had not labored, and towns that you had not built, and you live in them; you eat the fruit of vineyards and olive yards that you did not plant.</div>
<div class="line">14&nbsp;“Now therefore revere the&nbsp;Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness; put away the gods that your ancestors served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the&nbsp;Lord.</div>
<div class="line">15&nbsp;Now if you are unwilling to serve the&nbsp;Lord, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors served in the region beyond the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my household, we will serve the&nbsp;Lord.”</div>
<div class="line">16&nbsp;Then the people answered, “Far be it from us that we should forsake the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;to serve other gods;</div>
<div class="line">17&nbsp;for it is the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;our God who brought us and our ancestors up from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and who did those great signs in our sight. He protected us along all the way that we went, and among all the peoples through whom we passed;</div>
<div class="line">18&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;drove out before us all the peoples, the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore, we also will serve the&nbsp;Lord, for he is our God.”</div>
<div class="line">19&nbsp;But Joshua said to the people, “You cannot serve the&nbsp;Lord, for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins.</div>
<div class="line">20&nbsp;If you forsake the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you harm, and consume you, after having done you good.”</div>
<div class="line">21&nbsp;And the people said to Joshua, “No, we will serve the&nbsp;Lord!”</div>
<div class="line">22&nbsp;Then Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the&nbsp;Lord, to serve him.” And they said, “We are witnesses.”</div>
<div class="line">23&nbsp;He said, “Then put away the foreign gods that are among you, and incline your hearts to the&nbsp;Lord, the God of Israel.”</div>
<div class="line">24&nbsp;The people said to Joshua, “The&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;our God we will serve, and him we will obey.”</div>
<div class="line">25&nbsp;So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made statutes and ordinances for them at Shechem.</div>
<div class="line">26&nbsp;Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a large stone, and set it up there under the oak in the sanctuary of the&nbsp;Lord.</div>
<div class="line">27&nbsp;Joshua said to all the people, “See, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it has heard all the words of the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;that he spoke to us; therefore it shall be a witness against you, if you deal falsely with your God.”</div>
<div class="line">28&nbsp;So Joshua sent the people away to their inheritances.</div>
<div class="line">Joshua 24:1-28</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Prayer:</strong>  Loving Father we&nbsp;begin to&nbsp;understand more and more that we can't&nbsp;be divided in our loyalty... for You alone have the words of eternal life. Today, Lord we choose to&nbsp;go deeper into You, for we desire to serve You with our whole heart. Keep us and our families serving You in humility of heart and help us to&nbsp;keep walking in Your light and truth every moment of the day... and looking to Jesus, in Whose name we pray, AMEN.</p>

<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>I heard a story about a husband who really enjoyed the meal his wife had served for dinner one night. He asked her, &quot;What did you marinate this in?&quot; Well, his wife immediately went into a long explanation about how much she loved him and how life wouldn’t be the same without him, and so on. Eventually, his puzzled expression made her interrupt her answer with a question of her own: &quot;Why did you ask me that?&quot; He said well I just wondered how you made the meal, she chuckled and said, &quot;I thought you asked me if I would marry you again!&quot;</p>
<p>As she left the room, he called out, &quot;Well, would you marry me again?&quot; Without hesitation, she replied, &quot;Vinegar and barbecue sauce.&quot;</p>
<p>Would you marry me again? Sometimes you’ll hear about a couple who’ve been married for 30, 40, or 50 years. They’ll have another wedding ceremony and repeat their vows once again to renew the pledge they made years ago. They say to one another, &quot;Years ago, I promised to love you, to honor you, to cherish you and to be faithful to you. And I want you to know that I meant what I said, and I am just as committed to you now as I was 50 years ago.&quot; I think that’s beautiful.</p>
<p>And a similar thing happens in the passage that was read this morning. In Joshua 24:15, Joshua says, Now if you are unwilling to serve the&nbsp;Lord, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors served in the region beyond the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my household, we will serve the&nbsp;Lord.”</p>
<p>Joshua is trying here to get the people of Israel to renew their covenant with God, to renew their commitment to God. We live in a day and time when a lot of people want to shy away from the word &quot;commitment&quot;. They don’t want to lock themselves in to a particular course of action; they want to keep all their options open. But the Lord says there comes a time when we need to renew our commitment with God. A time when we say, &quot;You know, Lord, twenty years ago, I made a commitment to you. I made a decision to put you first in my life. I made a decision to forsake my sinful ways and dedicate my life to you. And I want you to know that I meant what I said, and I am just as committed to you now as I was twenty years ago.&quot; That’s exactly what’s happening here in Joshua 24.</p>
<p>It’s too easy for all of us to fall back, to slip back, to lose our enthusiasm, to not be as fired up for God as we once were. There’s a natural tendency for things to slow down. Therefore, we need those times when we say, &quot;This is who we are, and this is what we’re about and this is what we’re going to do.&quot;</p>
<p>This morning, I want to take a look at this chapter in Joshua and notice six things that are involved in making any kind of spiritual commitment.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-reason-for-confidence">
<h3>1. A Reason For Confidence</h3>
<p>It’s interesting to notice here how Joshua brings these people to the point of decision. Starting in verse 2, he reminds the people of Israel of all the wonderful things God has done for them. He talks about how God blessed Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Then he talks about Moses and Aaron. He talks about how God brought the plagues on the Egyptians. He talks about how the Lord led the Israelites through the Red Sea and how the Red Sea closed down on the Egyptians and what a great victory it was. And then he takes them to the edge of Canaan, and he talks about how God gave them the promised land. Basically, he gives them a quick historical account of God’s dealings with his people, and how faithful God had been through the years.</p>
<p>The reason Joshua did that is because whenever you’re about to make a commitment, it’s important that you have a reason for confidence. So, Joshua tells them what God has done for them. He tells them about the faithfulness of God, and he says, &quot;You guys know these stories as well as I do. Think about how God has treated you. God has been faithful. On every turn, when we have trusted God, we have been victorious.&quot;</p>
<p>If this morning you’re willing to make a solemn covenant commitment with God, it must first of all start with this kind of confidence. Now, where do we find this kind of confidence? The key word, and Joshua uses it over and over in this book, is, &quot;remember&quot;. Time and again, he says, &quot;You need to remember.&quot; You see, God knows this -- if you’ll simply remember what he’s done, if in your mind you’ll remember his faithfulness, then you will be faithful to him.</p>
<p>Why? Because it’s in that memory that we see the work of God. And Joshua says to these people &quot;If you’ll just remember this, then out of a heart of gratitude you’ll want to make the right choice.&quot; You see, if you boil it down to the simplest terms, why do we serve God? Really out of gratitude. If you want to maintain a spiritual commitment to God, somewhere in your heart there’s got to be a spirit of thankfulness. You see, rules and regulations will only take you so far. Doing it because it’s the right thing will only last a while. But there must come a moment in your life when you say, &quot;Out of an appreciation that I have for God and all that he’s done for me, I want to serve him.&quot;</p>
<p>If you’ll remember, if you’ll simply look back and look at how wonderful God has been to you and how many times God has expressed his love for you, then the commitment will come easier.</p>
<p>So, the first key is confidence. In order to make this kind of commitment, the people that Joshua is talking to including us need confidence in God.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-strong-challenge">
<h3>2. A Strong Challenge</h3>
<p>The next key I see here is a strong challenge. In verse 14, Joshua said, 14&nbsp;“Now therefore revere the&nbsp;Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness; put away the gods that your ancestors served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the&nbsp;Lord.</p>
<p>Joshua comes to these people and he gives them a great challenge. He says, You need to throw away these gods that you’ve accumulated. You need to serve only the Lord. It seems to me that people respond to great challenges. I think one of the great problems in this country is that people are afraid to challenge us.</p>
<p>Why was Churchill such an effective leader in World War II? It wasn’t because he promised the British people a life of ease. It was because he said, &quot;I promise you nothing but blood, sweat, toil and tears.&quot; And people responded to that message. People seem to respond to great challenges. People don’t respond well to mediocrity. People don’t get excited about maintaining the status quo.</p>
<p>Why was Jesus so effective with people? Because he challenged them to their core. You never see Jesus compromise; you never see Jesus begging. Rather, you see Jesus saying, &quot;If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross and follow me.&quot;</p>
<p>There’s a book called Growing Up in America. And in that book, the author (Tony Campolo) explores why so many churches are losing their teenagers by the droves. And he makes this point: &quot;Our teenagers aren’t leaving us because we’ve asked too much. They’re leaving our churches because we’ve asked too little.&quot;</p>
<p>I think that’s true. They don’t have a desire to give themselves to something mediocre. They don’t have a desire to give themselves to an organization that’s unwilling to challenge and motivate and say, &quot;Let’s go for it.&quot; And so, they leave, It’s not because we’re asking too much but because we’re asking too little.</p>
<p>And here’s Joshua saying, &quot;You guys need to give up these gods. You need to serve the Lord and him alone.”   He is giving them a strong Challenge to forget about all of the other gods and only focus on Jesus.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ability-to-choose">
<h3>3. Ability to Choose</h3>
<p>The next thing we see here is that he gave them a choice. We need to have the ability to choose. Let’s look again at verse 15, 15&nbsp;Now if you are unwilling to serve the&nbsp;Lord, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors served in the region beyond the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living;</p>
<p>You know, one thing we need to understand about serving God is that it’s always voluntary. You don’t have to do it. If you don’t want to, don’t do it. I think there’s a great freedom in that. The Lord never created any of us to be robots. He doesn’t want any of us to do it just because we’ve got to do it. But rather he wants us to freely choose.</p>
<p>I find that interesting in the gospels about Jesus. I said a moment ago Jesus never begged anybody. Do you ever in the gospels see Jesus chase anybody down? The rich young ruler, when the Lord saw something very good in him, but when he left the Lord, you don’t see Jesus going, &quot;Oh, please come back, please, you need this, you’ve got to have this.&quot; You don’t see the Lord chase anybody.</p>
<p>Because the Lord understands that at the very core this is everybody’s choice. You know, I sometimes have a hard time with that. When there’s someone I really love, someone whom I want to see go to heaven more than anything else, I have a problem with allowing it to be their choice. I wish I could force people to do what’s right, but I can’t. We can express our love and the love of God, but in the end it’s their choice, and that can be a hard thing to accept.</p>
<p>We see it in Jesus. We see it here in Joshua. &quot;Guys, you choose what you’re going to do. I know what I and my family are going to do. But you do whatever you want to do.&quot; You know, there’s a freedom to that. Every now and then, we need to say to ourselves, this is my choice. Do you ever get discouraged at your job? I’m going to be honest sometimes I do. I know you find that hard to believe, because I work with all of you.  But sometimes I get discouraged, and I wonder if I am really making a difference.  I’m going to tell you I am not the only Pastor that feels that way. Anybody who has a job will wonder and get discouraged, it’s human nature.  And what I have to do is sit myself down and I say, &quot;OK, Pam, you know you don’t have to do this. If you don’t want to, you can go do something else.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;If you really don’t think you are helping or making a difference then don’t do it. Try something else.&quot;  But then there’s something within me that says, &quot;No! This is what I want to do. This is how I feel God wants me to use my talents.&quot;  Remember all the times you regretted not doing this sooner in your life.  Remember you chose to do this.  There’s a great exhilaration in being able to say, &quot;This is my choice.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>I want to tell you something this morning. If you’re struggling in your commitment to God, give yourself a choice. You don’t have to be here. You don’t have to do this. If you don’t want to do it, don’t. I know you’re thinking &quot;I can’t believe she is standing up there saying that!&quot; But that’s what Joshua said. He said, &quot;I’m not forcing you into anything, it’s your choice.&quot;</p>
<p>But once you do that, I think you’ll realize something. I know there were times in my life when I questioned my commitment to the Lord. Do I really want to live this lifestyle? And when I finally say, &quot;Well, go do something else&quot;, everything in me goes, &quot;No, I can’t do that. I believe this. This is right. This is true. This is where I belong.  I couldn’t turn my back on Jesus for anything.&quot; There’s something healthy about giving yourself that choice.</p>
<p>I challenge some of you this morning if you’ve been living for a while in mediocrity, sort of half-heartedly doing this thing, give yourself a choice. Get out of it if you don’t like it. But if you do want to serve the Lord then do it. As Joshua would say, &quot;Go for it. Throw away those foreign gods and accept only the Lord God.&quot; You’ve got to have that choice.</p>

<h3>4. Example of Conviction</h3>
<p>Joshua says at the end of verse 15, but as for me and my household, we will serve the&nbsp;Lord.”</p>
<p>That’s an example of conviction.</p>
<p>If you keep reading, you see where they say, &quot;No, Joshua, we want to serve the Lord.&quot; But it took that one voice. Sometimes it only takes one person willing to step out and say, &quot;God, I want to serve you.&quot; The problem with most of us is that we don’t want to be the first one, to take that step, to stick out. Most of us are waiting for that. This challenge from Joshua says, &quot;You guys do whatever you want to do, but let me tell you this. I know what me and Mrs. Joshua and our little ones are going to do. We’re going to serve the Lord.&quot; We need that in the church today, don’t we?</p>
<p>We need some adults to stand up and say, &quot;I’m going to serve God. I don’t care what the rest of the people think about me. I don’t care if they think I’ve gone fanatical and berserk, I’m serving the Lord. And I’m not going to be ashamed of it.&quot;</p>
<p>We need teenagers and young adults and mature adults to take a stand at school, at work wherever they are in life to just stand up and take a stand about their conviction.  I know it’s tough, you know it’s tough. But we need those who say, &quot;I’m making this commitment whether anybody else does or not. I’m going to serve the Lord.&quot; It’s that example of conviction that makes a difference in people’s lives.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-picture-of-the-consequences">
<h3>5. A Picture of the Consequences</h3>
<p>If you keep reading, you see here a picture of the consequences. It’s interesting. At the end of verse 18, the Israelites scream out, 18 Therefore we also will serve the&nbsp;Lord, for he is our God.”  And then look what Joshua says in verse 19, &quot;But Joshua said to the people, ’You cannot serve the Lord, for he is a holy God.&quot;</p>
<p>I find that interesting. Joshua challenges these guys. He says, &quot;You need to go for it, you need to choose.&quot; And they say, &quot;We’ve chosen, Joshua. Let’s do it.&quot; And then Joshua says, &quot;Sorry, guys, you can’t.&quot;</p>
<p>There are different ways you can look at this. But I think what Joshua is doing here is he’s making these people fight for their commitment. He’s saying, &quot;Guys, do you really want this? Do you really want it? Or are you saying this because I just preached a fired-up sermon today and I said you need to choose. Or are you doing this because this is what you really want to do?&quot;</p>
<p>Then he says in verse 20, 20&nbsp;If you forsake the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you harm, and consume you, after having done you good.”&nbsp; He’s saying, &quot;Look if you’re really serious about this, you need to look at the consequences. In the long run, what’s it going to be like to serve God, and what’s it going to be like to serve these foreign gods?</p>
<p>Beloved we’d do well today if we’d look more at the consequences of our lifestyle. You know, when you give yourself a choice you need to also raise the question, where will this lead? If I determine to live a life of selfishness, for my satisfaction and pleasure, then in the long run what kind of person will I be? Even on this earth, how happy will I be? And in eternity, where will I be? We need to look at those consequences.</p>
<p>And as we look at the consequences of serving the Lord, it may be more difficult and certainly more challenging, but the consequences are tremendous. So, Joshua forces the Israelites to look at the consequences. We all know it isn’t easy to serve the Lord, to be a Christian and to stand up for what our church believes in you can and probably will get backlash, be rejected, be hated, be ignored.  So, Joshua wants them to really understand what consequences they could be facing.</p>

<div class="section" id="write-down-a-covenant">
<h3>6. Write Down a Covenant</h3>
<p>Joshua then makes them write down a covenant. Look at verses 25-27 it reads 25&nbsp;So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made statutes and ordinances for them at Shechem.&nbsp;26&nbsp;Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a large stone, and set it up there under the oak in the sanctuary of the&nbsp;Lord.&nbsp;27&nbsp;Joshua said to all the people, “See, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it has heard all the words of the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;that he spoke to us; therefore it shall be a witness against you, if you deal falsely with your God.”</p>
<p>The last key factor in making this commitment is making a written covenant.</p>
<p>Joshua says, &quot;Guys, you said you want to serve the Lord, let’s get practical about this matter. Let’s put it on paper. Here’s what God wants. Let’s write it down. Let’s not just write it down. Let’s mark it. Let’s make this a place for you to remember what you did. Let’s make this a significant moment in your life where you mark this occasion.&quot;</p>
<p>A stone, or a pile of stones for some reason in that day was looked upon as a holy object. So, Joshua said, &quot;Here’s this stone under this beautiful tree. Let’s mark this spot right here as the place where you changed your life. Let’s write it down. And every time you see that rock, it will remind you folks of the covenant you made with God.&quot;</p>
<p>If we want to make a firm commitment to God, there’s a great need for that. What Satan can do is keep you in a constant state of indecision. You hear the message of God, you’re drawn to it, but you never quite make that commitment, you never quite say yes, you never quite say, &quot;Yes, Lord, this is it&quot;. And so, you spend half your life wavering between the Lord and Satan. Too afraid of hell, and too afraid of commitment to go one way or the other.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s significant what Joshua does here. He says, &quot;OK guys, you say you’re going to follow God. Let’s write this thing down.&quot; If you want to establish a goal, you better write it down. If you want to be firm about something, put it on paper. You have something to remind you, “that this is what you said you were going to do.</p>
<p>There is a story that has been going around on the internet for many years, I don’t know if it is true or not but it is supposed to be, I find some very curious similarities to the story and a move title God’s not Dead, But As the story goes, there was a professor of philosophy there who was a deeply committed atheist. His primary goal for one required class was to spend the entire semester attempting to prove that God didn’t or couldn’t have existed.  His students were always afraid to argue with him because of his impeccable logic. For twenty years, he had taught this class, and no one had ever had the courage to go against him. Sure, some had argued in class at times, but no one had ever ’really gone against him’. Nobody would go against him because he had a reputation.</p>
<p>At the end of every semester, on the last day, he would say to his class of 300 students, &quot;If there is anyone here who still believes in Jesus, stand up!&quot; In twenty years, no one had ever stood up. They knew what he was going to do next. He would say, &quot;because anyone who does believe in God is a fool. If God existed, he could stop this piece of chalk from hitting the ground and breaking. Such a simple task to prove that he is God, and yet he can’t do it.&quot;</p>
<p>And every year, he would drop the chalk onto the tile floor of the classroom, and it would shatter into a hundred pieces. All of the students could do nothing but stop and stare. Most of the students were convinced that God couldn’t exist. A number of Christians had attended his classes, but for 20 years, they had been too afraid to stand up.</p>
<p>Well, in walks a freshman who happened to get enrolled in the class. He was a Christian and had heard the stories about this professor. He had to take the class because it was one of the required classes for his major. and he was afraid. But for 3 months that semester, he prayed every morning that he would have the courage to stand up, no matter what the professor said or what the class thought. Nothing they said or did could ever shatter his faith, he hoped.</p>
<p>Finally, the day came. The professor said, &quot;If there is anyone here who still believes in God, stand up!&quot; The professor and the class of 300 people looked at him, shocked, as he stood up at the back of the classroom. The professor shouted, &quot;You FOOL!! If God existed, he could keep this piece of chalk from breaking when it hit the ground!&quot; He proceeded to drop the</p>
<p>chalk, but as he did, it slipped out of his fingers, off his shirt cuff, onto the pleats of his pants, down his leg, and off his shoe. As it hit the ground, it simply rolled away, unbroken.</p>
<p>The professor’s jaw dropped as he stared at the chalk. He looked up at the young man and then ran out of the lecture hall. The young man who had stood up proceeded to walk to the front of the room and share his faith in Jesus for the next half hour.</p>
<p>He was willing to stand up and take a stand for his beliefs, for Jesus.   Perhaps this needs to be the place where you mark the spot, you set up the stone, you say, &quot;Guys, I don’t know what anybody else in here is going to do, but I’m going to serve God.&quot; You don’t need to come forward, You don’t need to publicly display and discuss the sin in your life, but you may have the need to write something down, you may have a need to make a commitment in ink and say, &quot;God, I’m going to be yours.&quot;   In Confidence, In Challenge, In Choice, In Conviction, In Consequences and in Covenant.  I’m writing it down, I’m setting it in stone.  I believe, I love, and I am following your lead.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
