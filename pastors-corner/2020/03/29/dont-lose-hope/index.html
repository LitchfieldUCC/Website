         <h3>Today’s Scripture Reading is Ezekiel 37: 1-14 (The Valley of Dry Bones)</h3>
<p>
  <strong>37&nbsp;</strong>The hand of the&nbsp;
  <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&nbsp;was on me,&nbsp;and he brought me out
  by the Spirit&nbsp;of the&nbsp;
  <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&nbsp;and set me in the middle of a
  valley;&nbsp;it was full of bones.&nbsp;
  <strong>
    <sup>2&nbsp;</sup>
  </strong>He led me back and forth among them, and I saw a great many bones on
  the floor of the valley, bones that were very dry.&nbsp;
  <strong>
    <sup>3&nbsp;</sup>
  </strong>He asked me, “Son of man, can these bones live?”</p>
<p>I said, “Sovereign&nbsp;
  <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, you alone know.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <sup>4&nbsp;</sup>
  </strong>Then he said to me, “Prophesy to these bones and say to them, ‘Dry
  bones, hear the word of the&nbsp;
  <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>!&nbsp;
  <strong>
    <sup>5&nbsp;</sup>
  </strong>This is what the Sovereign&nbsp;
  <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&nbsp;says to these bones: I will make
  breath
  <sup>[
    <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezekiel+37&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-21403a">

      <span class="underline">a</span>
    </a>]</sup>&nbsp;enter you, and you will come to life.&nbsp;
  <strong>
    <sup>6&nbsp;</sup>
  </strong>I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover
  you with skin; I will put breath in you, and you will come to life. Then you
  will know that I am the&nbsp;
  <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.’”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <sup>7&nbsp;</sup>
  </strong>So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I was prophesying, there
  was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone.&nbsp;
  <strong>
    <sup>8&nbsp;</sup>
  </strong>I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered
  them, but there was no breath in them.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <sup>9&nbsp;</sup>
  </strong>Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath;&nbsp;prophesy, son of
  man, and say to it, ‘This is what the Sovereign&nbsp;
  <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&nbsp;says: Come, breath, from the four
  winds&nbsp;and breathe into these slain, that they may live.’”&nbsp;
  <strong>
    <sup>10&nbsp;</sup>
  </strong>So I prophesied as he commanded&nbsp;me, and breath entered them; they
  came to life and stood up on their feet—a vast army.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <sup>11&nbsp;</sup>
  </strong>Then he said to me: “Son of man, these bones are the people of Israel.
  They say, ‘Our bones are dried up and our hope is gone; we are cut off.’&nbsp;
  <strong>
    <sup>12&nbsp;</sup>
  </strong>Therefore prophesy and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign&nbsp;
  <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&nbsp;says: My people, I am going to open
  your graves and bring you up from them; I will bring you back to the land of
  Israel.&nbsp;
  <strong>
    <sup>13&nbsp;</sup>
  </strong>Then you, my people, will know that I am the&nbsp;
  <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,&nbsp;when I open your graves and bring you
  up from them.&nbsp;
  <strong>
    <sup>14&nbsp;</sup>
  </strong>I will put my Spirit&nbsp;in you, and you will live, and I will
  settle&nbsp;you in your own land. Then you will know that I the&nbsp;
  <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>&nbsp;have spoken, and I have done it,
  declares the&nbsp;
  <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.’”</p>
<h3>Today’s Sermon – Don’t Lose Hope</h3>
<p>Are you on pins and needles with everything that is going on in this
  world?</p>
<p>If so, you are not alone, and in many respects, this is a good thing.</p>
<p>This pandemic is new to all of us and not something that we have ever
  experienced before.</p>
<p>There is no precedent for those of us living in the 21st Century.</p>
<p>There is no established response, and therefore, you may find your emotions
  all over the board.</p>
<p>And that is okay.</p>
<p>That is normal.</p>
<p>Think about it, four weeks ago, it seemed to most Americans that things were
  great and under control.</p>
<p>We were healthy, many were wealthy, planning Spring Break Vacations, working
  while dreaming of the future—considering adding additions to our homes,
  spending frivolously, planning for graduations and weddings.</p>
<p>Then—and consider how astounding this is—a microscopic virus appears and
  suddenly causes the shutdown of the entire world.</p>
<p>It brings things, a bit, back to reality, does it not?</p>
<p>I mean, we aren’t invincible after-all.</p>
<p>Our social structures aren’t Impenetrable; we aren’t God.</p>
<p>Human-made security is but an illusion, and if the last few weeks haven’t
  shaken our collective pride to the point of admitting that, I don’t know what
  will.</p>
<p>How, then are we to understand ourselves?</p>
<p>During this Corona Virus pandemic, many of us are tempted to fear.</p>
<p>We might experience anxiety and even despair.</p>
<p>Some people have lost their precious lives, some have lost those whom they
  love, some have lived through the misery of the illness, some have lost their
  jobs, their income, we fell isolated from our loved ones, our friends, our
  neighbors, our church and almost all of us are dealing with major disruptions
  to the normal flow of our lives.</p>
<p>How are you dealing with this crisis?</p>
<p>Do you have hope?</p>
<p>Or do you feel yourself giving in to fear and anxiety?</p>
<p>In our Scripture Passage for this morning, the utter hopelessness of Israel
  kind of mirrors our situation.</p>
<p>It was a very dark time for Israel.</p>
<p>Ezekiel himself was exiled to Babylon for 11 years, and during that time he
  delivered a message of doom and gloom.</p>
<p>Then, in 586 BCE Jerusalem fell, the Temple was burned to the ground and the
  Davidic Monarchy came to an end.</p>
<p>Think about it, everything they had ever trusted, everything that had given
  their lives shape and meaning was gone.</p>
<p>And worst of all—in their eyes, their God had been defeated by the gods of
  the Babylonians.</p>
<p>Could it be that their God wasn’t really Lord at all?</p>
<p>Or perhaps, God had deserted them in their darkest hour.</p>
<p>Israel was not only in exile; they were having a crisis of faith—and what
  could be worse?</p>
<p>And we hear their despair in verse 11: “Our bones are dried up and our hope
  is gone; we are cut off.”</p>
<p>And then—as it always does—God’s grace breaks through.</p>
<p>And Ezekiel goes from a prophet of doom and gloom to a prophet of
  hope—revival, restoration—preaching about a glorious future of redemption.</p>
<p>But, I’m getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>This prophet of doom and gloom says that “the hand of the Lord” picked him
  up and placed him in a valley of dry bones.</p>
<p>What a dark night of the soul that must have been.</p>
<p>Have you ever had a “dark night of the soul”?</p>
<p>Have you ever looked around at your life and your situation in life and seen
  nothing but, metaphorically of course, a valley of dead and dry bones?</p>
<p>Imagine Ezekiel’s situation.</p>
<p>God gives him this vision.</p>
<p>And all he sees for as far as the eye can see are bones.</p>
<p>Old, dead, dry bones.</p>
<p>Where is the hope?</p>
<p>Where is the life?</p>
<p>What good can come from here?</p>
<p>How would you feel in Ezekiel’s situation?</p>
<p>Would it be like a bad dream that you desperately tried to wake up from in
  order to escape the terror of it all?</p>
<p>And then, suddenly God is asking Ezekiel a question: “Son of man, can these
  bones live?”</p>
<p>It’s almost laughable is it not?</p>
<p>We are talking about old bones with no flesh on them.</p>
<p>They have been exposed to the elements for who knows how long?</p>
<p>There is no life in them whatsoever.</p>
<p>“Can these bones live?”</p>
<p>What would you say?</p>
<p>I often wonder if I ever write someone off.</p>
<p>Do I ever get so frustrated with another human being that I say to myself:
  “There is no hope for this person?”</p>
<p>“They will never change.”</p>
<p>“They will never accept Christ.”</p>
<p>“They will never get out of the muck and mess they are in.”</p>
<p>“They are just going to keep on doing whatever they are doing until they
  die.”</p>
<p>“I give up!”</p>
<p>Or how about a situation?</p>
<p>Do I ever think, “This ministry will never bear fruit?”</p>
<p>Or, “I don’t see anything good coming from all my efforts.”</p>
<p>“What’s the use?”</p>
<p>I know I do.</p>
<p>How about you?</p>
<p>That’s kind of like the situation Ezekiel is in.</p>
<p>His people are at the lowest of the lowest points in their entire
  history.</p>
<p>They are in exile.</p>
<p>They are even forgetting who they are.</p>
<p>They are giving up on their God.</p>
<p>Things have hit rock bottom.</p>
<p>And these “dry bones” God is showing Ezekiel is an image of their
  condition.</p>
<p>They are dead.</p>
<p>They have no more life.</p>
<p>It’s over.</p>
<p>All hope is gone.</p>
<p>And God asks Ezekiel, “Can these bones live?”</p>
<p>Again, if you were in Ezekiel’s place, what would you say?</p>
<p>How would you answer that question?</p>
<p>Or let’s look at it from another angle.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have been trying to get your life on-track for a really long
  time.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have promised God you would change your ways since you were a
  little kid and you are getting older now&mldr;</p>
<p>&mldr;and nothing has changed.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, things have gotten worse.</p>
<p>Your sins have become more perverse.</p>
<p>Your attitude has become completely rotten.</p>
<p>You have no joy, no peace, no happiness.</p>
<p>If God showed you your life up to this point, and asked, “Can these bones
  live?” what would you say?</p>
<p>The answer seems obvious.</p>
<p>Dry bones are the very definition of dead, gone, not coming back.</p>
<p>But Ezekiel chooses faith over despair.</p>
<p>He takes a leap.</p>
<p>And he answers God, “Sovereign Lord, you alone know.”</p>
<p>The story of Ezekiel reminds us that life itself is utterly and totally
  reliant on God.</p>
<p>And it offers us a glimmer of hope&mldr;</p>
<p>&mldr;Hope that God and God alone can, indeed, bring new life, even when
  everything seems to be completely hopeless, completely dead.</p>
<p>For nothing, nothing is impossible with God!!!</p>
<p>A valley of dry bones.</p>
<p>Such an image seems so final, like it’s the literal end of the road.</p>
<p>It’s hard, almost impossible to have hope in these moments.</p>
<p>And if you have lost your job due to the Corona Virus, you may be feeling
  that way today.</p>
<p>Or, if you are a recent college graduate searching for a job, during such a
  time as this, you may be feeling as if all hope is lost.</p>
<p>So many are struggling to understand and stay strong and keep hope during
  this time.</p>
<p>And here, in our Scripture Passage for this morning, we read some of the
  first hints of our ultimate hope&mldr;</p>
<p>&mldr;some of the first hints of Resurrection.</p>
<p>God instructs Ezekiel to prophesy, to preach to these dry, brittle, dusty,
  well-beyond life bones.</p>
<p>And this is not the end of their story.</p>
<p>And that is because we see them come to life, as sinews and muscles and skin
  again cover the bones.</p>
<p>But, bones with skin and muscle are still, in a sense, just dead bones.</p>
<p>So, God breathed His breath into them.</p>
<p>And the word for breath here is the same word used back in Genesis when God
  created the first humans and breathed in them the breath of life.</p>
<p>It’s also the same word used for the Holy Spirit Who comes and lives and
  brings new life to all who will believe.</p>
<p>And the Lord says in verse 12: “I am going to open your graves and bring you
  up from them&mldr;I will put my Spirit in you, and you will live.”</p>
<p>And so, we see that absolutely nothing is impossible with God.</p>
<p>Absolutely no situation is beyond repair.</p>
<p>Absolutely no life is beyond the possibility of redemption, salvation,
  transformation.</p>
<p>And just as God breathed new life into the valley, putting the lives of
  these dead people back together, God’s promise is always a promise of new
  life!</p>
<p>My friends, as we face the unknowns, the uncertainties, the craziness of
  this Corona Virus&mldr;</p>
<p>&mldr;as we watch or read sermons on our computers rather than joining together
  in worship as we have always done&mldr;</p>
<p>&mldr;as we get “cabin-fever” and listen to the frantic voices on the news&mldr;</p>
<p>Let us remember that we worship a God of Resurrection, even though we may
  feel as if we are in valley of dry bones or tombs of darkness.</p>
<p>In these difficult places where hope seems lost and all seems to be at the
  end, God gives us breath&mldr;</p>
<p>&mldr;Life-giving breath.</p>
<p>As we deal with this Virus and as we enter these final days of Lent, my
  prayer for you and for me is that we will take that breath and ask God to renew
  our spirits&mldr;.</p>
<p>&mldr;That we will remember that God breathes new life even into the most
  difficult places and offers us TRUE HOPE—new Life—Resurrected Life!</p>
<p>And having this new life can be as simple as taking a breath of God’s
  Spirit.</p>
<p>So, how about making every breath you take your prayer, heightening your
  awareness of God’s presence with you, of God’s offer of salvation and
  Resurrection—even when you feel completely dead.</p>
<p>So, let’s take deep breaths&mldr;</p>
<p>&mldr;let’s take lots of them.</p>
<p>And as we do, may God’s breath be a gift to us that we accept, and may we
  have new life.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
