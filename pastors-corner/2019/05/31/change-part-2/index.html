<p>“Day and Night” by M.C. Escher, 1937; from the book Change by Paul Watzlawick &amp; John Weakland, W.W. Norton, 1974.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I appeal to you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship</div>
<div class="line">- Romans 12:1 RSV</div>
</div>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Sometimes it seems that the only constant in life is <em>change</em>. As much as we
treasure the members of our families and friends and the things we have done for
generations past, we all know that our children become adults, friends sometimes
move out-of-state, homes fall into disrepair, and other changes happen for which
we have not planned. Whether it is the closing of Pat Catan’s, the opening of
Aldi or new construction on N. Court Street or changes in our weather patterns,
we have all learned that <em>change</em> is a constant. Our challenge is a matter of what
we do with it.</p>
<p>You may remember the article I wrote for you last year entitled <a class="reference external" href="/pastors-corner/2018/05/25/change/">“Change”</a> where I
mentioned one of those books I had read some 40 years before and how it impressed
me. At the time I wrote:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">It seems that when my life situation begins to settle down, another change is just waiting around the corner. I think we all know it to be true - whether it’s a change in jobs, or homes, or health. Sometimes it’s a graduation. Sometimes it’s the death of a friend. Sometimes it’s the economy. The devil of it is, it seems, that the older we get the more often change lies in waiting for us and pounces upon us when we do not expect it. (May 25, 2018, referring to Change by Paul Watzlawick &amp; John Weakland, 1974.)</div>
</div>
<p>However, there is often an upside to <em>change</em>. In the article I told you that the book:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">... does not complain about being caught unawares, but tells in detail how change opens new possibilities that we would otherwise never consider. In fact, the authors talk about how our human nature resists change even when it might be good for us. They discuss the old saying, “the more something changes the more it remains the same.”</div>
</div>
<p>At that time, however, I did not anticipate that I would be saying farewell to
all of you at this time. I have had the privilege to be your pastor for more
than four and a half years. We began on Sunday, November 2, 2014. Together, we
saw the excavation of the church basement, Christmas caroling, numerous pageants
at Christmas and Easter, confirmation class and new members, Memorial Day
parades, ice cream socials, vacation Bible school, working at the Medina County
Fair, not to mention special services of worship during Advent/Christmas and
Lent plus funerals and weddings and nursing home visits plus a host of many
other dinners, meetings, and experiences. Without doubt, our time together has
been phenomenal.</p>
<p>Early in May, this year, I received a call from the Akron area superintendent of
the United Methodist Church asking if I would be willing to serve the Lockwood
U.M. Church located south of Akron on Manchester Rd. The congregation has been
averaging about 40 people on Sunday mornings in a building that had worshiped
more than 600 each Sunday in the 1970s. They needed a pastor who was familiar
with Alcoholics Anonymous, food pantries, clothing exchanges, study groups,
children’s ministries, and willing to do pastoral calling, hospital visits and
having the ability to lead creative worship and music - plus be willing to serve
part-time because the congregation is not able to afford more than a half-time
salary without a parsonage, pension, or healthcare. I told the superintendent
that I was already serving the Litchfield congregation and if I were to leave,
their welfare had to be assured.</p>
<p>After considerable thought and knowing that the denomination was in crisis
posibly leading to schism, I felt that my call back to the United Methodist must
be timely and needed, particularly in light of my experience in education,
Christian service, and conflict management. I also spoke with our Association’s
General Minister (United Church of Christ) who assured me that she would help
Litchfield find proper leadership.</p>
<p>On May 12 we announced at Litchfield my departure (My last Sunday was to be June
2.). At their next meeting our Church Council began planning for worship on the
Sundays in June and I was assured, with the help of our UCC association, that
the congregation will be ably led by outstanding leaders every Sunday in the
months ahead.</p>
<p>I will miss all of you and look forward to hearing from you to know how things
continue. I feel privileged to have been your pastor for the time we have had
together. As I transition to begin this new adventure, I want you to know that
you will <em>always</em> have a friend in Akron.</p>
<p>Blessings always,</p>
<p>‒ Pastor Jim</p>
