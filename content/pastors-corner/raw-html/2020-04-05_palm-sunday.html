<p>Matthew 21:1-11</p>
<p>Now when they drew near Jerusalem and came to Bethphage at the
    Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples saying to them, Go
    into the village opposite you and immediately you will find a
    donkey tied, and a colt with her. Loose them and bring them to Me.
    And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, The Lord has
    need of them, and immediately he will send them. All this was done
    that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying
    Tell the daughter of Zion Behold, your King is coming to you, Lowly
    and sitting on a donkey A colt the foal of a donkey. So the
    disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them. They brought the
    donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and set Him on
    them. And a very great multitude spread their clothes on the road;
    others cut down branches from the trees and spread them on the
    road. Then the multitudes who went before and those who followed
    cried out, saying: Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who
    comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest! And when He
    had come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is
    this? So the multitudes said, This is Jesus, the prophet from
    Nazareth of Galilee</p>
<p>Today is a good day to talk about our attitude</p>
<p>More importantly our attitude towards Jesus</p>
<p>These days in this time of change and quarantine we all have
    attitudes about the things in our lives. We can have a positive
    attitude, A negative attitude, A good attitude, A bad attitude, An
    attitude of love, An attitude of hate or even an attitude of
    indifference</p>
<p>Our attitude is often what causes us to view a circumstance as a
    blessing or a curse</p>
<p>Our attitudes can set the wheels in motion for how any situation
    will affect us our families, those around us and our lives.</p>
<p>Our attitude is a choice.</p>
<p>Pastor Chuck Swindoll had this to say about attitude. “The
    longer I live, the more I realize the impact of Attitude on life.
    Attitude to me is more important: than facts, More important than
    the past, More important than education, More important than money,
    More important than circumstances, More important than failures,
    More important than successes, More important than what other
    people think or say or do, More important than appearances, More
    important than skill. Attitude will make or break a company…a
    church…a home.”</p>
<p>The Amazing thing is we have a choice every day regarding the
    Attitude we will embrace for that day.</p>
<p>We cannot change our past. We cannot change the inevitable. The
    only thing we can truly change in many situations in our lives is
    our Attitude. I believe that life is 10% what happens to me and 90%
    how we react to it. And so it is with us… We are in charge of our
    attitudes.”</p>
<p>Today is Palm Sunday</p>
<p>The day we celebrate Jesus’ ‘triumphal entry into Jerusalem. One
    of the steps in the last week of Jesus’ life on the earth as a
    human. And one the first steps on the road to “it is finished”</p>
<p>There were many attitudes in the faces of the crowds on that day
    and it is my prayer as we look at their attitudes we can see
    ourselves in those faces and in those attitudes.</p>
<p>God’s word tells us in all four of the gospels Matthew, Mark,
    Luke, and John that Jesus Riding into Jerusalem caused a great stir
    in that city.bHuge crowds had already arrived for the celebration
    of the Passover there were huge crowds of people in town for the
    celebration and those crowds were made up of individual people and
    with those people came attitudes and those attitudes towards Jesus
    made all the difference as to how those people viewed the events.
    About how they viewed Jesus and even how they viewed themselves. As
    we will see this morning we often share those same attitudes. And
    those attitudes can have a huge impact on how we view the
    situations in our lives, How we view Jesus, How we view others and
    even how we view ourselves.</p>
<p>Palm Sunday is a time for us to examine our attitudes toward
    each other as well as toward God. In a way, Palm Sunday is about a
    huge parade coming into town with one main attraction. The center
    of that parade is Jesus and our attitude towards him a makes all
    the difference in the world as to our response to him</p>
<p>Let me set the scene for you. Jesus has less than a week to live
    and he knows it. He has after a little over 3 years of public
    ministry decided to make it known publicly that He is the long
    awaited Messiah, the King that God’s people has been waiting for,
    for hundreds of years. We read in the Old Testament a prophecy
    about a King who would come into the city riding on a colt.
    Zechariah predicted it would happen over 500 years before Jesus was
    born.</p>
<p>Zechariah 9:9 reads</p>
<p>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout, O daughter of
    Jerusalem! Behold, your King is coming to you; He is just and
    having salvation, Lowly and riding on a donkey, A colt, the foal of
    a donkey.</p>
<p>The time had finally come and Jesus was ready to take the next
    step. He’s riding towards his whole reason for being, which was to
    obey God the Father. Riding towards the completion of his calling
    In the faces in the crowd on that day. On that wonderful day there
    were thousands of people with thousands of attitudes</p>
<p>This morning I would like to with your blessings to look at just
    a few of those faces and attitudes and what they mean to us</p>
<p>First we see the Committed. The true followers of Jesus. Not
    perfect people, people with flaws and weaknesses But committed
    followers who were trying hard to let Jesus rule their lives.
    Trying to leave their old lives and their old habits and their old
    hang ups behind and truly let him be the Lord of their lives. In
    these committed followers we see an Attitude of Gratitude, An
    attitude of Praise, An attitude of Awe, An attitude of service.
    Many of these committed followers had received Jesus’ healings,
    many had been the recipients of his blessings. I have no doubt
    there were some who had tasted the bread and fish on the mountain
    at the feeding of the 5000.</p>
<p>Some may have tasted the water that had turned to wine. These
    had seen his miracles, had heard his teachings and were grateful.
    They were ready to Praise Jesus. Committed followers with an
    attitude of praise, thankfulness and awe. Ready to risk all, Give
    Jesus the reins of their lives.</p>
<p>Next in the crowd we see the Confused. These are the people who
    maybe had heard about Jesus, they had heard of his miracles maybe
    even experienced them, But, This man Jesus</p>
<p>did not seem to be what they were expecting. He was riding a
    donkey not a great white stallion</p>
<p>he was coming in humility not as a reigning king as they
    expected or hoped. Their initial attitude was excitement for the
    events, excitement about the prospects, but we know excitement
    often fades when things are no longer new. These people most likely
    believed Jesus was a great teacher, a prophet, a good man, But,
    their attitudes kept them from accepting him as Lord, as the
    savior. They saw Jesus but many left unchanged when the parade was
    over when all that was left on the road was coats, palm leaves and
    donkey poop, and their excitement turned to disappointment</p>
<p>The next faces we see in the crowd are the Pretenders. The
    religious frauds. These pretenders acted like they knew Jesus, told
    people they knew Jesus. But In John’s account of the Triumphal
    entry John tells us many were just going through the motions,
    Shouting Hosanna, Shouting praise him but having an attitude of
    Disbelief, an attitude of skepticism. Seeing but still not
    believing. Just playing church. Still living life their way by
    their rules but wanting to be seen at the party, showing up simply
    to be seen, r for what they could get.</p>
<p>Next we see the curious. The seekers. Many came because they
    were curious, they wanted to see this man, they had heard about him
    and his works, they were curious. Thank God for the curious because
    it is often curiosity that brings people to Jesus. God puts it in
    the hearts of men to seek him and curiosity often brings people to
    salvation. I have no doubt many who came on this day saw Jesus and
    left changed. The curious bring with them an attitude of Wonder, an
    Attitude of seeking, an attitude of there must be more to life than
    this. Curiosity can be a great gift when it leads to the discovery
    of truth it can also be a curse when it leads us from the truth</p>
<p>The last faces and attitudes we will see today are the Opposers.
    Those who are hostile to Jesus, to God, to the message. Those who
    want to stop him and his message. The Pharisees, Sadducees, the
    religious leaders, the Roman Government. Even one of Jesus’ own
    disciples, Judas, falls into this group. They bring attitudes of
    hatred of distrust and they often bring attitudes of deceit and
    manipulation.</p>
<p>The religious leaders who opposed Jesus in the crowd lied,
    manipulated, set traps, justified, hardened their hearts and
    refused to see, refused to listen, refused to be changed and did
    everything to keep anyone from seeing or believing. Everything to
    stop him and his word. Even trying to stop him by killing him,
    which they did. We know they were unsuccessful all they did was
    fulfill the prophecy.</p>
<p>On the road to Jerusalem on the back of a donkey Jesus saw many
    faces and saw many attitudes. In the crowd were those who loved
    Jesus and those who hated him. Those who were committed, those who
    were confused, those who were pretending to be something they were
    not, those who wanted to stop him and many who were just
    indifferent more concerned about their own lives and problems, too
    busy to be concerned with Jesus</p>
<p>What is your attitude towards Jesus? When he looks in your face
    what or who does he see?</p>
<p>A few days after He rode in Jesus called his disciples together
    and shared with them a last meal. He would soon be betrayed,
    rejected, tried, tortured and killed for them and for us – for the
    sins of the world. And in sharing that meal he is telling them and
    us to remember what he has done. Telling us to look at ourselves
    and see our own faces. To search our attitudes, to search our
    hearts.</p>
<p>Are we committed or Confused? Curious or Pretending? Or are we
    opposing Jesus and his word? What is our attitude towards Jesus?
    Why are you here? Why have you come to Jesus?</p>
<p>What attitude do you need to change?</p>
<p>After hearing this message will you leave with Jesus changed or
    unchanged</p>
<p>Even though we can’t be together today to take part in the
    Lord’s supper (our communion)</p>
<p>Let me read for you from the apostle Paul</p>
<p>Let this remind you why we should look at our attitudes before
    we take the Lord’s Supper</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 11:27-28</p>
<p>“So anyone who eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord
    unworthily is guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the
    Lord. 28 That is why you should examine yourself before eating the
    bread and drinking the cup.</p>
<p>I Corinthians 11:23-26</p>
<p>. On the night when he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took some
    bread and gave thanks to God for it. Then he broke it in pieces and
    said, “This is my body, which is given for you, Do this in
    remembrance of me.”</p>
<p>25 In the same way, he took the cup of wine after supper,
    saying, “This cup is the new covenant between God and his people—an
    agreement confirmed with my blood. Do this in remembrance of me as
    often as you drink it.”</p>
<p>26 For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are
    announcing the Lord’s death until he comes again.</p>
<p>Today as we begin holy week, let us remember the sacrifice that
    was made for us. The suffering and the pain that Jesus endured. The
    betrayal and heartbreak that he encountered.</p>
<p>I know that right now we are all going through a time of
    mourning and loss, because we aren’t able to see our family, our
    friends, we aren’t able to do the things that are normal to us. We
    aren’t able to meet together and worship and fellowship. But we
    need to keep a prayerful heart. We need to keep an attitude of love
    and commitment to Jesus, to our Father in Heaven and to each other.
    This will pass and we will once again be reunited with those we
    love and care about, much like one day we will be reunited with
    Jesus as he makes a triumphant return. </p>

<p>Amen</p>
