*You Belong Here.* We are located at 3928 Avon Lake Road, right in the circle of Litchfield. Our Sunday worship service begins at 9:00am and we offer Sunday School during our worship service for any children that are attending. Children are welcome to be a part of the service if they aren’t comfortable being in Sunday School.

Our Sunday service is also live streamed on our `Facebook Page <https://www.facebook.com/LitchfielUCC>`_.

Our hall is available to rent for parties, showers, and other events. Please note alcohol cannot be served at any event in the church.

Pastor Pam Hahn is available for special services such as weddings, baptisms, and funerals.
