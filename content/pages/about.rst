About Our Church
================

:save_as: about.html

Litchfield United Church of Christ Congregational began as a hearty group of
pioneers from Connecticut who came to the Western Reserve to start a new life.
They built homes and established farms in the newly founded Litchfield Township
of Medina County. They were hard-working, independent, and self-reliant.
They also cared for their neighbors, organized a school, built a church and
a community.

Now, more than 180 years later, as a congregational church, we continue to live
out the values of our pioneering ancestors - community, compassion, foresight
and self-reliance - all within the Grace of God.

Whether ministering to the sick, caroling to shut-ins, giving food and aid to
the needy, or just accommodating the weary traveler during Sunday morning
worship; Litchfield United Church of Christ is here for everyone. Our towering
white spire is a beacon of hope, help, and glory to all who hear the ringing of
it's carillon.


Our Statement of Purpose
------------------------

The purpose of the Litchfield United Church of Christ Congregational shall be to
share the Word of God, in its various forms, with members of our church family,
our community, and the world.

We endeavor to follow the example of Christ in reaching out to all persons
regardless of age, gender, race, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. We believe
that all persons have sacred worth, equal in the eyes of God.

We know that we live in a time of change as did Jesus in his day; and, centered
in Christ, we seek to respond in love to the challenges that present themselves.
